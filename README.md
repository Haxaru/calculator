# calculator

I think this was one of the harder projects to do. Something I struggled with was understanding how to store the variables and how to call the operate function

I didn't understand why I needed to include the parameters in the called function, but I realize it now. Overall this was a nice project to do. I learned a lot from it.

A weakness I realized I had is understanding parameters and arguments, along with simplifying my code and keeping it minimal.

Something I am really struggling with right now is handling multiple operators.

quick update: I was still not able to solve the multiple operators bug, but I will leave it for another day.
